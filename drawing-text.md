A few starting notes toward the exploration:

This is difficult and crazy. Compare to a code-like interface where when you want text, you can get a stream, which is basically an array that gives values over time. In the code like interface each value can be a character in a stream of characters that represent user input/output. In this world on the other hand, it seems like we want a stream of coordinates that will change over time.

People on the web have posted hacks that animate the stroke of the svg or svg-text object. That solution works nicely for some text objects, but not others.
