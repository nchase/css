# Quines in HTML+CSS, JS Optional

Creating a contenteditable quine is simultaneously one of the most absurd and satisfying things you can do.

## Starter notes:

1. Create a simple page (DTD, head, body)
2. Stick a `<style>` tag in the head
3. Set `display: block` on `<head>` and `<style>`
4. Add `contenteditable`, um wherever. You get live-updating for free, well, unless you enter a carriage return where you shouldn't.
5. Remember that `contenteditable` is magical, yet fundamentally broken.

I hope to update this space with a demo that makes all of the other demos of similar behavior shudder and weep.
