Reflection
==========

Here are the questions I ask after I write CSS:

* Did I match the design?
* Did I repeat code?
  * If there is repeated 'positional' code, can I extract that out into a 'class'
    and immediately start using that class safely?
* Did I target the elements I'm interested in appropriately?
  i.e. not too specific, not too broad, not tied
  to a tagName unless there's a good reason to do so.
