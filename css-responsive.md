# 'Responsive' CSS

1. CSS is 'responsive' by default.

2. We should be adding rules for larger devices, not taking them away
   for smaller devices.

3. Trying to "remove" rules (by building stylesheets for the widest possible device,
   then overriding those styles for narrower devices) will introduce a lot of
   complexity into your code.
